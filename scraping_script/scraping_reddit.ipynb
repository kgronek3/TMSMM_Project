Quit being a complete sack of shit that people want to meet women and move on with their life to start something instead if waiting around like a hopeless loser. Fuck you mod. Let me reiterate more this mod needs to be kicked for being subjective and lame.\n",

      "mylah91  :  Sorry mods, but you forgot that Askmen users are from all over the world and in many countries covid is not such a big problem anymore, there is no quarantine and people can meet, travel etc. Some countries don't allow big events or parties, so it is harder to meet new people, but nothing wrong if someone wants to meet someone new. So this question is relavant\n"
